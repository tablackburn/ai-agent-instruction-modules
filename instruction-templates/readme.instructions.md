# README Instructions

## Purpose

Guidelines and requirements for maintaining `README.md` files in repositories using these instructions.

## Requirements

- The `README.md` must always reflect the current repository structure, naming conventions, and
  setup instructions.
- Whenever you make changes to files, instructions, or workflows, review and update the
  `README.md` to ensure:
  - All file and directory names are accurate and up to date
  - All setup and usage instructions match the latest practices and workflows
  - The repository structure diagram is correct
  - Any new or deprecated features are documented
- Use clear, concise language and follow Markdown best practices (see `markdown.instructions.md`).
- Place repository-specific or maintainer-only notes in clearly marked sections.
- Reference the CHANGELOG.md file for a summary of recent changes.

## Best Practices

- When making changes to instructions, templates, or workflows, update the `README.md` as part of
  your change process.
- Include a checklist item for README review in pull requests and release notes.
- Ensure consistency between the `README.md`, instruction files, and actual repository contents.
