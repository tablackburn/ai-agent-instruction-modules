# Git Workflow Instructions

Guidelines for consistent Git usage across repositories.

## Branch Naming

Use descriptive, lowercase branch names with hyphens:

```text
<type>/<short-description>
```

**Types:**

- `feature/` - New functionality
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation only
- `refactor/` - Code restructuring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**

```text
feature/user-authentication
fix/login-validation-error
docs/api-documentation
refactor/database-queries
test/payment-integration
chore/update-dependencies
```

**Avoid:**

- Spaces or special characters
- Overly long names
- Generic names like `fix`, `update`, `changes`

## Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```text
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Formatting (no code change)
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Adding/updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Guidelines:**

- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep first line under 72 characters
- Capitalize first letter after type
- No period at end of subject line
- Separate subject from body with blank line

**Good examples:**

```text
feat: Add user authentication flow
fix: Resolve null reference in payment processing
docs: Update API endpoint documentation
refactor: Extract validation logic to separate module
```

**Avoid:**

```text
Fixed stuff
WIP
updates
asdfasdf
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Creating a PR

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with the base branch
1. Run tests locally and verify they pass
1. Review your own changes first
1. Remove debugging code and console logs

### PR Title

Use the same format as commit messages:

```text
feat: Add user authentication flow
```

### PR Description

Include:

- **Summary** - What changed and why (1-3 bullet points)
- **Test plan** - How to verify the changes work
- **Breaking changes** - Note any breaking changes

**Template:**

```markdown
## Summary

- Added user login and logout functionality
- Integrated with OAuth2 provider
- Added session management

## Test Plan

- [ ] Login with valid credentials succeeds
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials shows error
- [ ] Logout clears session

## Breaking Changes

None
```

### PR Size

- Keep PRs focused and small when possible
- Large changes should be split into logical commits
- If a PR is too large, consider breaking it into smaller PRs

## Branching Strategy

### Default Branch

- Use `main` as the default branch name for new repositories
- `main` is the industry standard and preferred for inclusive terminology
- When working with existing repositories using `master`, follow the repository's convention
- Consider migrating legacy repositories from `master` to `main` when practical

### Main Branch

- `main` is the production-ready branch
- Should always be in a deployable state
- Direct commits to main should be avoided

### Feature Branches

1. Create feature branch from `main`
1. Make changes in small, logical commits
1. Push branch and create PR
1. After review and approval, merge to `main`
1. Delete feature branch after merge

### Keeping Branches Updated

```bash
# Update your feature branch with latest main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```

Prefer rebase for feature branches to maintain clean history.

## Merge Strategy

### Squash and Merge (Recommended for feature branches)

- Combines all commits into one clean commit
- Keeps main branch history clean
- Use when feature branch has many small/WIP commits

### Merge Commit

- Preserves full commit history
- Use for significant features where history is valuable
- Use for release branches

### Rebase and Merge

- Applies commits linearly without merge commit
- Use when commits are already clean and logical

## Git Safety

### Before Force Pushing

- Never force push to `main` or shared branches
- Only force push to your own feature branches
- Always communicate with team before force pushing shared branches

### Avoiding Common Issues

- Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts
- Don't commit sensitive data (secrets, credentials, API keys)
- Use `.gitignore` for build artifacts and dependencies
- Review staged changes before committing

## Useful Commands

```bash
# View branch status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline -10

# Amend last commit (before pushing)
git commit --amend

# Stash changes temporarily
git stash
git stash pop

# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# View changes before committing
git diff --staged
```
