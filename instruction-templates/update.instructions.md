# Update Instructions for AI Agents

These instructions are self-contained for update procedures but assume familiarity with Git.
For general workflow guidance, see agent-workflow.instructions.md.

## Configuration Schema

Repositories control AIM behavior through `aim.config.json` in the repository root:

```json
{
  "version": "latest",
  "modules": {
    "include": ["agent-workflow", "powershell", "markdown"],
    "exclude": []
  },
  "externalSources": {
    "enabled": true,
    "repositories": [
      {
        "name": "awesome-copilot",
        "url": "https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot",
        "path": "instructions",
        "description": "Community-contributed instructions from GitHub"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Configuration fields:**

- `version` - Target AIM version: `"latest"` or specific version (e.g., `"0.8.0"`)
- `modules.include` - List of modules to include (without `.instructions.md` extension)
- `modules.exclude` - List of modules to exclude (takes precedence over include)
- `externalSources.enabled` - Enable fetching from external repositories
- `externalSources.repositories` - List of external instruction sources

## Update Procedure

When updating AI agent instructions in a repository that uses AIM, AI agents should:

### 1. Read Configuration

- Check if `aim.config.json` exists in the repository root
- If it exists, read all configuration fields
- If it doesn't exist, use defaults: version=latest, all modules, externalSources disabled

### 2. Clone the Centralized Repository

- Clone: `git clone https://github.com/tablackburn/ai-agent-instruction-modules.git`
- If targeting a specific version (not "latest"), checkout that tag: `git checkout v0.8.0`
- Use `AGENTS.template.md` from the cloned repository, NOT `AGENTS.md`
- The file `AGENTS.md` in the centralized repository is that repository's own implementation
- The file `AGENTS.template.md` is the template for downstream repositories

### 3. Summarize Changes

- Read the current version from the downstream repository's `AGENTS.md` header
  (e.g., "Template Version: 0.7.0")
- Read `CHANGELOG.md` from the cloned upstream repository
- Extract all version sections between the current version and the target version
- Provide the user with a brief summary of what has changed, noting any breaking changes
- If the current version equals the target version, inform the user they are already up to date

### 4. Determine Modules to Sync

Based on `aim.config.json`:

- If `modules.include` is specified, only sync those modules
- If `modules.exclude` is specified, exclude those from the sync
- Core modules (`agent-workflow`, `update`) should always be included unless explicitly excluded
- `repository-specific.instructions.md` is NEVER copied from upstream

### 5. Sync Instruction Files

For each instruction file in the upstream `instruction-templates/` folder:

1. Check if the module should be synced based on configuration
1. Check if the file already exists in the downstream `instructions/` folder
1. **If the file exists, ask the user:**
   - "File X already exists. Overwrite with upstream version? (yes/no/diff)"
   - If "diff", show the differences between local and upstream versions
   - Only overwrite if the user confirms
1. **If the file is new**, copy it without prompting

### 6. Handle External Sources

If `externalSources.enabled` is true and a needed language/framework instruction is not found in
AIM:

1. Check each configured external repository in order
1. For awesome-copilot, look in the `instructions/` path for matching `.instructions.md` files
1. Download the instruction file and copy to the downstream `instructions/` folder
1. Inform the user which files were fetched from external sources

**Example external fetch:**

```text
Fetching python.instructions.md from github/awesome-copilot...
Fetching react.instructions.md from github/awesome-copilot...
```

### 7. Update AGENTS.md

- Replace the HTML comment block at the top (the comment starting with `<!-- THIS IS THE TEMPLATE`)
- Update the sync date to today's date
- Update the template version to match the upstream version
- Preserve any "Repository-Specific" sections from the existing file

### 8. Update Configuration

If new modules were added or configuration changed during the update:

- Update `aim.config.json` to reflect the current module selection
- Ask the user if they want to enable/disable any modules going forward

### 9. Validate and Clean Up

- List all files in the local instructions directory
- Verify file structure matches expected configuration
- Remove the cloned repository folder to prevent nested Git repositories

## Adding New Modules

When the user requests a new instruction module that doesn't exist locally:

### From AIM Repository

1. Check if the module exists in `instruction-templates/`
1. If found, copy to `instructions/` and update `aim.config.json`

### From External Sources

1. If not in AIM and `externalSources.enabled` is true:
1. Search configured external repositories for matching instruction files
1. Download and copy to `instructions/`
1. Add the module name to `aim.config.json` modules.include

### New Language Detection

If the user adds new source files in a language not currently covered:

1. Detect new file extensions (e.g., `*.py` files added)
1. Check if corresponding instruction exists locally
1. If not, suggest fetching from external sources
1. Ask user: "Python files detected but no python.instructions.md found. Fetch from awesome-copilot?"

## Sync Checklist

- [ ] Configuration read from `aim.config.json`
- [ ] Target version determined (latest or pinned)
- [ ] Correct version/tag checked out from upstream
- [ ] Change summary provided to user (from CHANGELOG)
- [ ] Module list determined based on configuration
- [ ] User prompted before overwriting existing files
- [ ] New modules copied without prompting
- [ ] External sources checked for missing modules (if enabled)
- [ ] AGENTS.md updated with new version and sync date
- [ ] Repository-specific content preserved
- [ ] Configuration updated with any changes
- [ ] Cloned repository folder cleaned up

## Content Preservation Rules

- The file `repository-specific.instructions.md` must NEVER be copied from upstream
- Repository-specific sections in AGENTS.md should be preserved
- Local customizations to instruction files should be flagged before overwriting
- Template sync date should be updated to current date
- Template version should match the centralized repository version

## Handling Breaking Changes

When upstream structural changes occur (e.g., renamed files, moved directories):

- Review the upstream changelog for breaking changes
- Compare file structure between current and target versions
- If `instruction-templates/` replaces `instructions/` as the source folder, adapt accordingly
- Rename local files to match upstream naming
- Update `aim.config.json` if module names changed

## Version Tracking

- **Current version**: Stored in `AGENTS.md` header as "Template Version: X.Y.Z"
- **Target version**: Configured in `aim.config.json` version field (defaults to "latest")
- **Change history**: Available in upstream `CHANGELOG.md`, follows semantic versioning
- Use version pinning for stability in production repositories
- Use "latest" for repositories that want to stay current with upstream changes
